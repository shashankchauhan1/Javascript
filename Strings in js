In JS Strings are immutable


it is a sequence of characters : "Shashank" 	<-- this is a string

let str="javascript";

few string inbuilt functions:
1> length : to find the length of the string.

let str="shashank";
console.log(str.length);	// output : 8

2> access through index.

let str="shashank";
console.log(str[0],str[7]);
